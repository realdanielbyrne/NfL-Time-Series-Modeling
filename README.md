## Motivation

- To Win!
- Gamblers on average win between 53% and 55% of the time.
- Bettors make ~$93,000 a year

Even a +1%  can mean yield $$$ depending on bets made and amount wagered.  


## Traditional Sports Modeling

Traditional methods rely on moving averages

- Dak Prescottâ€™s season completion% in 2016, 2018, and 2019 are within +/-1% of his career average.
- Players and Teams tend to revert to their mean

Vegas makes modifications to predictions for Home/Away, Weather, and Travel, etc to help improve these mean based predictions.  However, they are wrong 45 - 47% of the time.

## Cyclical patterns in human performance

- The wandering and cyclic behaviors evident in stats are a mirror into real life
- Good players have a higher mean than average players
- When all players on a team have a good game, that can raise the expectation of the team winning
